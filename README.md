## What You’ll Learn

- How to fork a reposotory
- How to clone your fork locally
- How to create a branch
- How to make changes and comit them
- How to push changes to GitHub
- How to create a pull request

## Your Mission 🎯

This README contains **intentional typos**. Your task is to:

1. Find and fix the typos
1. Submit your fixes via a pull request
1. (Optional) Add yourself to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file

Don’t worry - you can’t break anything! This is a practise repo designed for lerning.

## Prerequisites

- A GitHub account ([sign up here](https://github.com/join) if you don’t have one)
- Git installed on your computor ([installation guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
- That’s it! No other sofware needed.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Fork This Repositry

Click the “Fork” button at the top right of this page. This creates your own copy of the repositry.

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/first-pull-request.git
cd first-pull-request
```

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub usename.

### 3. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b fix-typos
```

You can name your branch anything discriptive like `fix-readme-typos` or `your-name-typo-fixes`.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Open `README.md` in your favorite text editor and fix the typos you find. Look carefully - there are typos thoughout this document!

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Fix typos in README.md"
```

### 6. Push to GitHubб

```bash
git push origin fix-typos
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
1. Click “Compare & pull request”
1. Add a clear title like “Fix typos in README.md”
1. Describe what you fixed
1. Click “Create pull request”

Congradulations! You’ve just made your first pull request! 🎉

## About Pull Requests

### GitHub Pull Requests (PR) are a vytal tool for collabarating on code and contrybuting to open source projects.

In this artical, we’ll cover some best practices for using pull requests effectivly to streamline your workflow and ensure that chanes are reviwed and tested before being merged into the main codebase.

**Best Practises:**

- **Create descriptive pull request titles and discriptions:** When you create a pull request, be shore to give it a discriptive title that summarizes the chanes you’ve made. It’s also a good idea to incloode a detaled description of the chanes in the pull request body, including any relevent context or background information. This will help other team members understand the chanes you’ve made and why they’re necesary.
- **Use branches to isolate chanes:** When making chanes to a codebase, it’s a good idea to create a new branch for each set of chanes you want to submit. This will make it easier to review and test the chanes, and it will also allow you to make addishunal chanes to the codebase without affecting the main branch.
- **Keep pull requests small and focussed:** It’s generaly easier to review and test smaller pull requests than larger ones. Try to limit your pull requests to a single, focussed chane rather than a large number of unrelated chanes. This will make it easier for other team members to review and test your chanes.
- **Use code review tools:** GitHub provides a number of tools to help you review code, including inline comments, line-by-line review, and code review templats. Use these tools to provide feedback and sugestions for improvement on the code you’re reviewing.
- **Respond to feedback and requests for chanes:** If someone leaves a comment or requests chanes on your pull request, be shore to respond in a timley manner. This will help ensure that the review process stays on track and that any necesary chanes are made before the pull request is merged.
- **Test your chanes:** Before submiting a pull request, be shore to test your chanes to ensure that they work as expected. This will help ensure that the chanes are ready to be merged and that they don’t intruduce any new bugs or issues.

By following these best practices, you can streamline your workflow and ensure that your pull requests are reviewed and tested effectivly. With a little bit of practise, you’ll be able to use GitHub Pull Requests to collabarate on code and contrybute to open source projects with confidance.
