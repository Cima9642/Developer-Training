## About Pull Requests

### GitHub Pull Requests (PR) are a vital tool for collaborating on code and contributing to open source projects.

In this article, we’ll cover some best practices for using pull requests effectively to streamline your workflow and ensure that changes are reviewed and tested before being merged into the main codebase.

**Best Practices:**

- **Create descriptive pull request titles and descriptions:** When you create a pull request, be sure to give it a descriptive title that summarizes the changes you’ve made. It’s also a good idea to include a detailed description of the changes in the pull request body, including any relevant context or background information. This will help other team members understand the changes you’ve made and why they’re necessary.
- **Use branches to isolate changes:** When making changes to a codebase, it’s a good idea to create a new branch for each set of changes you want to submit. This will make it easier to review and test the changes, and it will also allow you to make additional changes to the codebase without affecting the main branch.
- **Keep pull requests small and focused:** It’s generally easier to review and test smaller pull requests than larger ones. Try to limit your pull requests to a single, focused change rather than a large number of unrelated changes. This will make it easier for other team members to review and test your changes.
- **Use code review tools:** GitHub provides a number of tools to help you review code, including inline comments, line-by-line review, and code review templates. Use these tools to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement on the code you’re reviewing.
- **Respond to feedback and requests for changes:** If someone leaves ga comment or requests changes on your pull request, be sure to respond in a timely manner. This will help ensure that the review process stays on track and that any necessary changes are made before the pull request is merged.
- **Test your changes:** Before submitting a pull request, be sure to test your changes to ensure that they work as expected. This will help ensure that the changes are ready to be merged and that they don’t introduce any new bugs or issues.

By following these best practices, you can streamline your workflow and ensure that your pull requests are reviewed and tested effectively. With a little bit of practice, you’ll be able to use GitHub Pull Requests to collaborate on code and contribute to open source projects with confidence.
